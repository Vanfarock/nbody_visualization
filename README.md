# N-Body Visualization

This repo serves as a visualization tool for N-Body Simulations

It receives a file where each line represents the state of the simulation at time t (where t is line number)

At each frame, will be created a .jpg image out of what is being rendered on screen

Finally, these files will be passed to FFMPEG and converted to a .mp4 video
